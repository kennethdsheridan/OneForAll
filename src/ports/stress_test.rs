/// `StressTest` Trait
///
/// This trait is a port in the hexagonal (or ports-and-adapters) architecture.
/// It abstracts the functionality for running stress tests on a system.
/// Implementors of this trait can provide different strategies for performing stress tests,
/// such as CPU load, memory pressure, I/O stress, etc.
///
/// The `StressTest` trait acts as an interface that defines how stress tests should be executed,
/// allowing for different implementations that can be swapped out without affecting the core logic
/// of the application. This approach follows the Dependency Inversion Principle, promoting
/// loose coupling and high flexibility in the application design.
///
/// ## Methods
///
/// - `run_cpu_tests`: Method to execute CPU stress tests. Implementations of this method
///   should contain the logic to stress the CPU resources of the system.
///
/// ## Extensions
///
/// Additional methods for different types of stress tests (like memory, I/O, etc.)
/// can be added to this trait. This allows for a unified interface for all stress testing,
/// making it easy to extend and maintain.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// Implementing the `StressTest` trait for a specific stress testing strategy:
///
/// ```rust
/// struct MyStressTester;
///
/// impl StressTest for MyStressTester {
///     fn run_cpu_tests(&self) {
///         // Implementation for CPU stress testing
///     }
/// }
///
/// let tester = MyStressTester;
/// tester.run_cpu_tests(); // Execute the CPU stress tests
/// ```
pub trait StressTest {
    /// Executes CPU stress tests.
    ///
    /// This method should be implemented to define how the CPU stress tests are conducted.
    /// The implementation can vary based on the specific requirements or characteristics
    /// of the stress testing tool or strategy being used.
    ///
    /// Implementors should ensure that this method effectively stresses the CPU
    /// and can optionally provide mechanisms for monitoring or logging the test progress
    /// and results.
    fn run_cpu_tests(&self);

    // Placeholder for other stress test methods.
    // For example:
    // fn run_memory_tests(&self);
    // fn run_io_tests(&self);
}
