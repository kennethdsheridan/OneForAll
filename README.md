**iperf3**: A widely-used network performance measurement tool, essential for bandwidth testing.

**stress-ng**: A tool for stress testing systems, vital for evaluating hardware robustness.

### Engineered in Rust, a decision driven by several key benefits:

**Multi-Architecture and Multi-Platform | One tool for heterogeneous hardware environments:**

OneForAll stands out with its exceptional multi-architecture and multi-platform capabilities. Designed to be universally adaptable, it is the diagnostic tool for any environment running Linux or macOS. This flexibility ensures that OneForAll can operate seamlessly across various systems, making it an incredibly versatile solution for diverse enterprise needs. Whether you’re working on traditional x86 architecture or exploring the realms of ARM, OneForAll delivers consistent performance and reliability, reinforcing its status as a go-to tool for comprehensive system diagnostics and performance enhancement.

**Performance:** Rust provides performance close to low-level languages like C, making it ideal for backend systems
where efficiency is paramount.

**Low Latency:** Rust's lack of a garbage collector translates to predictable, low-latency operation, crucial for
real-time applications.

**Memory Safety:** Rust's ownership model ensures memory safety, preventing common bugs and security vulnerabilities.
